## 🎨 Design Process: From Figma to Code

This project started as a high-fidelity design in Figma. The goal was to create a visually striking, youth-centric interface with a dark, futuristic aesthetic. Every component, from the glassmorphic cards to the color palette and typography, was meticulously planned in Figma before being translated into clean, semantic HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS.

This design-first approach ensured a cohesive and polished user experience across all pages.
